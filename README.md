*T*his *W*eek *i*n *A*ustin is meant to be a repository for code to make a playlist for upcoming artists in the Austin area. 

## Workflow
Briefly, the plan is to:

- [ ] scrape websites for arists playing in Austin
- [ ] Use a finetuned BERT model to idenfity artists
- [ ] Validate these artists with Spotify
- [ ] Make a playlist of these artists using the Spotify API

This is a pretty daunting task, but I think I'm up to it. Stay tuned to see my progress as I attempt to learn a few new things along the way.
